# kubectl

[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is the CLI tool to manage and operate Kubernetes clusters.  You can install it as follows.

## MacOS
From Homebrew:
```
brew install kubernetes-cli
```

From the [official kubernetes kubectl release](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/):

```
wget -O kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## Linux
From the [official kubernetes kubectl release](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/):

```
wget -O kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```
## kubectl usage
`kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]`

where command, `TYPE`, `NAME`, and `flags` are:
- `command`: Specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources, for example create, get, describe, delete
- `TYPE`: Specifies the resource type. Resource types are case-sensitive and you can specify the singular, plural, or abbreviated forms.
- `NAME`: Specifies the name of the resource. Names are case-sensitive. If the name is omitted, details for all resources are displayed, for example $ kubectl get pods
- `flags`: Specifies optional flags. For example, you can use the -s or --server flags to specify the address and port of the Kubernetes API server.
Important: Flags that you specify from the command line override default values and any corresponding environment variables

```bash
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.
